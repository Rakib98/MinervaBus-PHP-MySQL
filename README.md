# MinervaBus-PHP-MySQL
Website that I used to create an interaction between PHP and MySQL.
The website only adds and deleted records, it is the first PHP website that I built.
The website design is the same used for the "Walsall Tourism" website.
To use MySQL I used myslqi, which is an old technologies, most people uses PDO; but mysqli is what they used in college to teach us,
so I had to stick with it.
